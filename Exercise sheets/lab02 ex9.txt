Exercise 9 â€“ Style matters
In the repository you will find the ILoveProgramming.java, which is supposed to print 20 times "I love programming!". But for some
reason it only prints it once. Can you spot the error? Try to fix it.

public class ILoveProgramming {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int numberOfiLoveProgrammingPrints = 20;

		for (int iLoveProgrammingPrintCount = 0; iLoveProgrammingPrintCount <= numberOfiLoveProgrammingPrints; iLoveProgrammingPrintCount = iLoveProgrammingPrintCount+1);{
			System.out.println("I love programming!");
		}
	}
}
