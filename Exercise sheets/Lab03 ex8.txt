Exercise 8 â€“ Refactoring: Extracting variables
As seen in the lecture, there are several reasons why applying a clean coding style is helpful. One way to do that is extracting variables,
which is a useful refactoring technique wrt. code maintainability. In VS Code, you can extract a variable from an expression by selecting
it, right-clicking and selecting Refactor... and then Extract to local variable . Finally, provide a name for the new variable. Try this by
extracting variables for each of the 3 expressions (between the operators) in the if-statement of the code snippet below.
Write a new program VariablesExtracted.java that is based on the existing class VariableExtraction.java from the repository, that
contains the code snippet. Apply the refactoring technique described above to the code in your new program.
1 String platform = " macOS Sierra ";
2 String browser = " Safari ";
3 double zoomLevel = 1.5;
4 if ( platform . toUpperCase () . indexOf ("MAC") > -1 && browser . equals (" Safari ") && zoomLevel >=
1.5) {
5 // do something ...
6 }


Here's the class:
public class VariableExtraction {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String platform = "macOS Sierra";
		String browser = "Safari";
		double zoomLevel = 1.5;

		if (platform.toUpperCase().indexOf("MAC") > -1 && browser.equals("Safari") && zoomLevel >= 1.5) {
			// do something ...
		}
	}
}
