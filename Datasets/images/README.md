=== USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ===

--------------------------



To use the dataset for the training of CNN models (e.g. the ones that are in CNN training folder in the root directory), place the `dataraw` and `datapreprocessed` folders inside the working directory of the python file for the according CNN model, as it expects to find it in its CWD.



Otherwise, you're expected to modify the python codes accordingly to adapt it for custom usage.
